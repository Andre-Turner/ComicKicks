<h1>Rockin' adidas</h1>

<p>Adidas was born out of a sibling rivalry.After working together for years at the family company called Gebrüder Dassler, Adi Dassler and his older brother Rudolf began to bump heads. They split the company and its assets and, in the late 1940s, formed two separate companies: adidas and Puma. Adolf "Adi" Dassler, wanted the brand to be called "Addas" after the split with his brother Rudi. His registration was turned down because there was already a German children's shoe company with that name. While Adidas's current collection features sneakers for nearly every sports, the first pair of Adidas were track spikes made especially for track and field.In fact, Jesse Owens was an early adopter.After trying on a third pair, Owens was hooked; he stated that “he wanted those shoes or none at all." The athlete proceeded to win four gold medals.The world recognizes the three stripes as the trademark for adidas now, but the stripes were not Dassler's until 1951, when he purchased them from the Finnish shoe brand Karhu. Smit wrote that two stripes were used back at Gebrüder Dassler, so they were out, and four stripes seemed “too busy.”When adidas expanded into apparel, it adopted the trefoil as its logo. The trefoil is a clover-like plant with three-lobed leaves, which fit with the brand's existing stripe motif. Michael Jordan was actually a huge fan of adidas and wanted to sign a shoe deal with them.Distributors reportedly wanted to make it happen, but executives wanted taller players to represent the brand on court.Nike offered Jordan a $500,000 per year contract, which he took back to adidas to see if they could “come anywhere close,” but the brand had to pass.Missing out on Jordan was—and still is—one of the biggest missteps in adidas history. Adidas would still go on to be a legendary brand as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was the brand's first contracted basketball player, while tennis star Stan Smith made sales soar when he signed on and got a silhouette named after him. Adidas continue to evolve and revolutionize and has made great moves by adding the influential taste of Kanye West and Pharrell Williams to roster. </p>
