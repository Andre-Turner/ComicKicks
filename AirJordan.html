<h1>AIR JORDAN</h1>

<h2>History Of Air Jordan</h2>

<p>The Air Jordans have been a staple in the world of sneakerheads since their debut in 1985.If you love sneakers, then it is unlikely you haven't heard of Air Jordans. One of the world's most successful shoe lines, Air Jordans are a legacy that penetrated sports and fashion. Whether you already own a pair or plan to buy in future, here are some interesting facts about the brand that is a family of technologically advanced, aesthetically designed, and high-performance shoes. Michael Jordan was initially an "Adidas fanatic" but we have great thanks to David Falk for convincing MJ to sign with Nike. Though not a easy battle to convince the mega star, David Falk and mother Jordan finally persuaded Mj to ink the deal. The first Air Jordan was actually banned due to the NBA's strict uniform shoe color rule. Michael was fined $5,000.00 each time he wore the shoes.The league even wrote an infamous letter to Nike in February 1985 explaining that the black and red shoes were prohibited. Nike capitalized on this, reportedly paying the fines for Jordan and creating an ad campaign that played on that forbidden fruit quality. The 'Jumpman' is one of the most famous athletic logos and has featured on all sneakers after first appearing on Air Jordan III in 1988. The logo depicts a silhouette of Michael leaping in the air, with legs stretched, about to dunk. Now is a great time to introduce you to Tinker Hatfield.Tinker Hatfield is one of the world's most legendary sneaker designers, and currently Nike's Vice President for Design and Special Projects. He designed the Air Jordan 3 through 15 before taking a break from the line, and then coming back to design the Air Jordan XX, XXIII, XXV, and XXIX. Hatfield has designed the most iconic pairs of Jordans and nikes, stamping him a legend amongst the sneaker community.</p>
