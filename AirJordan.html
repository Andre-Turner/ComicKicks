<!--<h1>AIR JORDAN</h1>

<h2>History Of Air Jordan</h2>

<p>The Air Jordans have been a staple in the world of sneakerheads since their debut in 1985.If you love sneakers, then it is unlikely you haven't heard of Air Jordans. One of the world's most successful shoe lines, Air Jordans are a legacy that penetrated sports and fashion. Whether you already own a pair or plan to buy in future, here are some interesting facts about the brand that is a family of technologically advanced, aesthetically designed, and high-performance shoes. Michael Jordan was initially an "Adidas fanatic" but we have great thanks to David Falk for convincing MJ to sign with Nike. Though not a easy battle to convince the mega star, David Falk and mother Jordan finally persuaded Mj to ink the deal. The first Air Jordan was actually banned due to the NBA's strict uniform shoe color rule. Michael was fined $5,000.00 each time he wore the shoes.The league even wrote an infamous letter to Nike in February 1985 explaining that the black and red shoes were prohibited. Nike capitalized on this, reportedly paying the fines for Jordan and creating an ad campaign that played on that forbidden fruit quality. The 'Jumpman' is one of the most famous athletic logos and has featured on all sneakers after first appearing on Air Jordan III in 1988. The logo depicts a silhouette of Michael leaping in the air, with legs stretched, about to dunk. Now is a great time to introduce you to Tinker Hatfield.Tinker Hatfield is one of the world's most legendary sneaker designers, and currently Nike's Vice President for Design and Special Projects. He designed the Air Jordan 3 through 15 before taking a break from the line, and then coming back to design the Air Jordan XX, XXIII, XXV, and XXIX. Hatfield has designed the most iconic pairs of Jordans and nikes, stamping him a legend amongst the sneaker community.</p>-->

<!--<h2>Banned 1s</h2>

<p>Few shoes in the 30-plus-year history of the Air Jordan line are as famous as the black and red Air Jordan 1. The sneaker—known colloquially as the "Banned" Jordan 1 or the "Bred" Jordan 1—has been perennially important, from the murky mythology around its genesis to the fervor its retros inspire. As legend has it, the NBA banned the first iteration of Michael's Jordans, stating they violated the league's rule that a sneaker must be mostly white and reflect the colors of the team's jersey. Jordan was reportedly fined $5,000 for every game he wore the banned Air Jordan 1 sneakers. The league even wrote an infamous letter to Nike in February 1985 explaining that the black and red shoes were prohibited. Nike capitalized on this, reportedly paying the fines for Jordan and creating an ad campaign that played on that forbidden fruit quality </p>

<p>The Air Jordan 1s were an immediate success upon their first release: A May 1985 article from the Chicago Tribune mentions them selling out. Early orders and sales brought in over $55 million for Nike, and the brand anticipated selling between 3 and 4 million pairs in the first year of the shoes' release.</p>

<h2>Flu Game</h2>

<p>Basketball is a team sport, but few single-player performances stand out more than Michael Jordan's Flu Game in June 11, 1997. Fighting through debilitating flu, Michael Jordan managed to end the game with a stat line of 38 points, 7 rebounds, 5 assist, and 3 steals. Jordan played 44 mins with the sweats, shakes, and spins and would go on to scoring a pivotal late game 3 pointer that would secure the win for the Chicago Bulls. This iconic game perfomance is a historic moment in sports. </p>

<h2>Off White</h2>

<p>Off White and Air Jordan is an collaboration featuring designs from Virgil Abloh, a designer from Rockford, IL born in 1980. Virgil Abloh is an artist, architect, and fashion designer. After earning a degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, he obtained a master's degree in Architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology. It was at the Illinois Institute of Technology where Abloh was introduced to a curriculum established by Mies van der Rohe, formed from the notions of Bauhaus, that taught him to combine the fields of art, craft and design. Abloh's collaboration with the brand began in 2017 with “The Ten” collection, a partnership that produced some of the most coveted sneakers of all time. In that release, Abloh deconstructed 10 Nike sneaker models, quite literally. His hands-on creative process includes using Sharpies, zip ties, and X-Acto knives. Abloh's creativity and uniqueness is a great appreciation to the sneaker and fashion community. With deep compassion Sneaker Museum would like to say R.I.P to Virgil Abloh. he passed away 11-28-2021. Abloh left a great mark in the world and we be celebrated forever. </p>
