<p> New Balance has been producing shoe accessories and footwear for over one hundred years and they are one of the best known trainer brands in the world. New Balance was founded in Boston in 1906.It was founded by William J. Riley who had emigrated to the United States from the UK. New Balance are different to other sports companies such as Nike because they manufacture all of their products in the US and UK. They have five facilities in the US and one in the UK. They sell their products in over 120 countries worldwide and all of these products are made in these six facilities. Their shoes are designed with technical features. This includes things such as heel counters and blended gel inserts. The main target audience for the products that they were selling were people that were on their feet all day at work. The first product that the company made was an arch support which was placed inside footwear. This product provided support for the foot in three different places. The founder of the company, William J. Riley, observed the way that the chickens in his yard used the shape of their feet to help them balance and this was his inspiration. Whether you're in need of a comfortable shoe for long work days or a great piece for you wardrobe, New Balance has many options. </p>
