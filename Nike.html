<h1>Just Do It</h1>

<p>Nike was founded on January 25th, 1964 by Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight.The idea for a sneaker company came to Phil Knight while he was writing a paper in college. He hooked up with Onitsuka Tiger because he believed the Japanese-made shoes could compete with Puma and Adidas. The famous Nike logo, a solid swoosh, was designed for just $35 by Carolyn Davidson, a student at Portland State University. Later on, she was given more than $640,000 worth of Nike products.The headquarters are based in Washington County, Oregon, USA. An unknown fun fact about the slogan 'Just Do It' was inspired by a serial Killer name Gary Gilmore. Gilmore's last words were 'Let's Do It' and that is the inspiration behind one of the biggest slogans known across the world. Nike has apparel and shoes worn across the globe. Over the years, Nike has made some award-winning commercials, and in 2000 and again in 2002, the company won an Emmy award. Nike takes up nearly 62% of the market for athletic shoes. </p>
