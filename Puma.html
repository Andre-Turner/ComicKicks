<p>In 1924, Rudolf and his brother Adolf Dassler had jointly formed the company Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik which translates to “Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory."Due to a fight between brothers, they decided to open a separate factory so Adi changed the name of his factory too. He called it adidas.Rudolf Dassler originally registered the new-established company as Ruda, but later changed the name to PUMA.The logo with the jumping cat, today one the most famous trademarks worldwide, is created by Lutz Backes, a cartoonist from Nuremberg.n 1936 Olympics Dassler shoes adorned the feet of gold-medal-winning Olympians and their business boomed. There were two rival soccer clubs in which on was sponsored by adidas and the other by Puma. Rudolf wanted his shoes to be of the characteristics of a puma cat; speed, agility, and strength. PUMA becomes the first sports shoe manufacturer to use the technologically advanced vulcanization production technique, whereby the sole and the shaft of the boot are bonded.To this day Puma remains the go to footwear for many olympians. Usain Bolt - The World's Fastest Man- set a world record at the Beijing Olympics wearing Puma apparel and footwear.  </p>
