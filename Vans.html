<h1>Off The Wall</h1>

<p>Like Converse, Vans started small. The brand was founded on March 16th 1966, on the city of Anahiem, California. Brothers Paul and Jim Van Doren and 2 business partners opened a store (Van Doren Rubber Company) dedicated to skaters.Shortly after, the brand started to sell shoes for competitions. One of its funders even became a professional runner to test the prototypes. In 1976, appeared the Vans #95 model, now known as Vans Era. Created by Tony Alva and Stacy Peralta, two skaters, this model has extra padding around the collar to increase the skater's comfort. In 1977, the brand launched another icon, the Style 36, today known as Old Skool, the first pair with the recognizable side stripe, before known as “jazz stripe”. Shortly after in 1978, the high top version was launched, called Sk8-Hi.In 1977, Vans also created the Vans #98 model, known as Vans Slip-On. This pair had such a high level of sales that pushed them to open 70 new stores throughout California.The slogan “Off The Wall” means outside the norm or out of the ordinary. Though, since the brand's dedicated to skaters it can also mean off the floor or wall. Vans celebrated 50 years since creation and continues evolve.</p>
